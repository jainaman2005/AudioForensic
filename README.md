The Repo consist of the logic for the audio Forensic to detect whether the record are of the suspected person or not

# 🔐 Audio Forensics in Cybersecurity
## 🎯 Project Overview

This project explores the use of **audio forensics** within the context of **cybersecurity** — identifying, analyzing, and matching audio evidence for digital investigations. It leverages signal processing techniques and machine learning tools to detect similarities or anomalies in audio recordings, which may be used in cybercrime investigations, identity verification, or evidence authentication.

## 🛡️ Objectives

- Analyze and process audio recordings relevant to cybersecurity cases  
- Extract audio features for comparison and forensic analysis  
- Detect manipulated or mismatched audio clips  
- Support investigative tasks like speaker verification, tampering detection, and audio traceability

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Librosa** – Audio processing  
- **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **Matplotlib** – Analysis and visualization  
- **IPython.display** – Audio playback for inspection

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-forensics-cybersecurity.git
   cd audio-forensics-cybersecurity
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**
   Open `audioMatching.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and follow the workflow step-by-step.

## 🧪 Features & Workflow

- Load and inspect suspicious or forensic audio recordings  
- Preprocess and normalize audio  
- Extract key audio features (e.g., MFCCs, chroma, spectral contrast)  
- Compute similarity metrics or detect manipulation patterns  
- Visualize feature data and enable expert review  
- Playback audio samples for manual verification

## 🔍 Use Cases

- **Voice spoofing detection** in phishing attacks  
- **Tampering analysis** in recorded calls or messages  
- **Audio authentication** for digital evidence validation  
- **Speaker identification** in criminal investigations  
- **Deepfake voice detection** in fraud scenarios  


## 📌 Notes

- This project is a proof of concept and should be extended with domain-specific datasets and forensic standards for professional use.
- Accuracy depends heavily on recording quality and preprocessing techniques.
